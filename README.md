# Ascendium Modeling Exercise : REAL TIME FIRST PRICE AUCTIONS

**Dataset used**: Ascendeum_Dataset2.csv
The dataset contains the revenue for each adunit for the month of June,2019


## Quick read:
The solution for the modeling exercise is provided.
The jupyter notebook for the solution is given in "Ascendium_v2.ipynb".
The reserve price for each ad units are given in the  "reserve_price_july.csv".

**QUESTIONS**
1.	What is the potential revenue range our publisher can make in July?
      The revenue generated during the month of June is $3956311.92/-. The potential revenue range our publisher can make in July is between $3941315.10/- to $4213663.11/- according the modelling performed.

2.	What are the reserve prices that he/she can set?
      There have been 40687 ad configurations including the different configurations of geo_id, adtype_id, device_category_id, os_id, monetisation_channel_id (given in assumptions). The reserve price for the same has been given in the csv file attached with email.



## Elaborate reading:
**Assumptions:**
1.	Advertiser is not known prior. So the advertiser input has not be taken.
2.	The 'total_revenue' has values upto 4 decimal points and hence it is multiplied by 100. Currency is assumed as $. 
3.	It is assumed that the publisher is auctioning the different versions of the ad_unit in different geo_id, device_category_id, os_id, ad_type_id, and monetization_channel_id separately. So the reserve price for each is found out.
4.	The negative 'total revenue' value has not been removed.
As the dataâ€™s are joined together, the effect of same might not affect much.

**Conclusions after understanding the data:**
1.	All the ad unit id's are independent and are not depend on site_id. But site_id might have an influence on the number of impressions.
2.	The characteristics for an adunit and their category count include

>
     Number of site_id                  =10
     Number of ad_unit_id              	=132
     number of ad_type_id              	=2 
     Number of device_category_id      	=5
     Number of os_id                   	=7
     Number of geo_id                  	=219
     Number of intergration_type_id    	=1 (not considered as it same for all)
     Number of monetization_channel_id 	=5
     Number of revenue_share_percent   	=1 
(not considered as all advertiser give full  amount to publisher)
    
3.	The characteristics of advertiser and number of categories include
>    	 Number of advertiser_id          =23 
(Not used as the publisher will not be knowing the advertiser during reserve price setting)
     
4.	The reserve price for an adunit should depend on the adunit characteristics and past impression/reserve price which are known prior. 

 The system developed should be able to predict the reserve price from the adunit characteristics and past impressions


## System modelling:

**Input variables**

Categorical:
>
    site_id
     ad_unit_id
     ad_type_id
     geo_id
     device_category_id
     os_id
     monetization_channel_id
Numerical:
>
     Total Impressions
     Viewable Impressions
     Measurable Impressions
     
**Output variable**
>   CPM or reserve price

**Regression model used:**
> 	XGBoost

**Explanation:**
A system has been modelled taking the ad characteristics and the impressions obtained using XGBoost regressor. The system has been trained to predict the reserve price. 
        However, from the practical knowledge we know that the reserve price for an ad location in a website should not be set below the already generating revenue and the predicted price should not be too high as indicated in the information given. 
       So the predicted price if it is less than the current amount it is updated to the current amount and if the predicted amount has deviation of more than 20% from the current amount it is set to the 20% margin amount. 

The predicted revenue range for July is found out using the model output obtained and the model output altered for the practical purpose.
